# Hi, I'm Dima - Front-End Developer ðŸ‘‹

Very nice to meet you! In this blog, I will tell you about myself, my experience, and my thoughts.

I am from Odesa, Ukraine. Sport is an integral part of my life. I played professional football for 5 years. Now I go to the gym for strength training and love to run in beautiful places.

I've been developing for over two years. I love what I do very much, and one of the main reasons is that I get to develop and learn new information every day. It's very motivating and changes your lifestyle.

## My Hobbies

My main technical hobby is learning new and interesting technologies. I often solve interesting tasks on my [GitHub](https://github.com/DmirtyYefymov), and generally keep an active GitHub with various repositories.

After work, I always go for a workout, either in the gym or running outside. Sprinting helps me unload and organize my thoughts. I always feel better after sports.

Reading new information is an integral part of my work, such as new documentation, interesting technical articles about web development, and books. I also pay attention to fiction. I love the _Witcher_ series by Andrzej Sapkowski, and I also like Stephen King in fantasy.

Another favorite hobby of mine is playing board games with my friends. We regularly get together to play some interesting board games.

## About My Experience in Web Development

I started learning web development with courses on the Udemy platform, and after that, I got into the WEBUI Club School of SoftServe. There we studied the basics of web development, and after graduation, I got an internship at SoftServe as a Front-End Developer (React.js).

My team and I worked on the development of the AED Map web application. This is an OpenTech project whose main function is to display up-to-date information about the location of defibrillators in the city. You can check out the project [here](https://opentech.softserveinc.com/uk/projects/map-of-public-defibrillators-in-lviv).

Main tasks our team completed:

-   Laying the most optimal route from the user's current geolocation to the nearest available defibrillator, working with the MongoDB database.
-   Setting up address search functionality.
-   Optimization of functional solutions.
-   Interaction with QA, resolving current bugs.

After completing my work on the project, I moved to another company as a Junior Front-End Developer. In this company, we worked with WordPress. We developed customized themes for WordPress. The company's product was news sites, and the goal was to create blogs on the website. Using the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin for WordPress, we created flexible content for reusable components. One of the main objectives was effective search engine optimization.

I combined my next job with the current one. It was a marketing agency based in Canada. We developed the agency's main website, [VD Agency](https://vd.agency). The technologies used on the project were React, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, and SCSS.

After that, I moved to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. I got a job at a Ukrainian product IT company - TRIONIKA. We work on a fintech project with expertise in attracting and monetizing Internet traffic. Development of the main website was done using React technology, while the company's service sites were supported using React-Admin.
